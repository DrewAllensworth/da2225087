Pseudocode for Gaddis Chapter 5 Problem 16

Calculate savings account ballance:

Get interest rate
Calculate annual interest rate
	annual interest rate = interest rate/100
Calculate monthly interest rate
	monthly interest rate = annual interest rate/12.0
Get the starting balance
	balance = starting balance
Get number of months since the account was established

for number of months since the account was established
	Get amount of deposits (validate: no negative numbers)
	total deposits=total depostits + deposits
	balance=ballance+deposits
	Get amount of withdrawals (validate: no negative numbers) 
	total withdrawals=total withdrawals + withdrawals
	balance=balance-withdrawals
	//calculate month's interest earned
	month's interest=(balance*annual interest rate)
	//calculate total interest
	total interest=total interest + month's interest
	//add interest
	balance=balance + month's interest
	if bal<0 then print error message and terminate loop

Output ending balance
output total deposits
Output total withdrawals
output total interest earned
